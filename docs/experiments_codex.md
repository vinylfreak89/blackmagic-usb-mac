# Codex experiment commitments

## E-codex-2026-09-22-1 — promote the measured top-search arm

**Owner's question/instruction (relayed):** "codex should be building the new
engine... not producing the renders based on half python, half C". The requested
top rule is a five-code margin over the derived horizontal level, next-row
11-of-16 chunk agreement on every candidate, and evidence-only plain23/run-in.
Bottom measurements and registration state transitions are not being changed.

**Premise.** On this tape, the new top rule improves high-confidence comb
agreement without relying on a Python copy of the engine or a different
pairing/reset history. This is a self-consistency check, not independent truth
about all source edges. The old rule must remain exactly reachable.

**Method.** Feed the same exact rasters, counters and the live sidecar's pairing
and reset flags to C probes built from c620966 and from the current engine with
explicit old (0,0,1,1) and proposed (5,3,0,0) controls. One streaming capture
pass, bounded per-unit memory; separate audit engines supply comb evidence while
non-audit engines supply CPU costs. Compare unit features bit-for-bit and frame
decisions by bottom-unit counter and top-unit identity. Score published
frame_d2-frame_d1 at margins 1.5/3/5/8, with and without counters >=90300;
enumerate gains/losses. Check the four requested labelled counters and inspect
the fade's missing-top placement fallback and the six requested edge cases.

**Preflight context.** The supplied arm feeder defaults to aligned throughout
and resets only on counter gaps. The live sidecar uses a pairing switch at
48189 and classifier resets. Those populations must be named separately;
the supplied figures must not be silently represented as live-path figures.

**Falsifier.** Any old-arm mismatch to c620966, change to bottom edges/profiles
or device blanking, failure of the four labelled counters, or decrease in the
live-path >=3/5/8 bands below counter 90300 prevents promotion pending review.
Report the unfiltered bands and every regression too. Missing-top fallback
must not be described as a general fade freeze if a decided comb or another
measured field can still move placement. No retuning after a failed gate.

**Material.** All 86,293 exact units of captures/fulltape.cap6; live pairing and
reset history from captures/fulltape_render_registration.csv. Supplied C arm
CSVs in scratchpad/ctr9040/arms are comparison evidence, not the oracle for
live framing/state. Synthetic tests cover default controls and protected paths;
unit/ASan/TSan checks follow any promoted implementation. Results stay in scratch.

**Pre-run addition (owner criterion 7).** The built default must reproduce every
non-timing column of ctr9040/arms/m5_g3_p0_r0.units.csv on all 86,293 units,
including rule_first/auto_first and evidence columns. Per-unit census is
independent of pairing/reset history. Any difference is reported, not reconciled;
the first ten differing counters carry both values. This is a separate gate
from scoring stateful placement with the live pairing/reset stream.

### Report

**Verdict: held for the specified numeric gate, not a general edge-truth or
fade-freeze claim.** The built default (5,3,0,0) exactly reproduces the chosen
C census on 86,293/86,293 units, every non-timing column included. The explicit
old arm (0,0,1,1) exactly matches c620966 on all 86,293 measured units and
86,289 frame decisions. Bottom edges, profiles, device blanking and derived
level provenance are unchanged on every unit. The four labelled counters pass.

With live pairing/resets and counters below 90300, agreement improves at all
four bands; >=5 gains 27 and loses 25, rather than the aligned-only gain of 29.
The supplied aligned-only percentages independently recount correctly, but are
not live-path figures. No thresholds were retuned. Field-1/field-2 unavailable
tops rise from 471/422 to 739/641. Noisy-level inflation remains uncured.

Raw checks on the six named units support removal of the accidental run-in
save: line 24 has 0..3/16 agreeing chunks and line 25 passes; the old rule scanned
24 then incremented to 25. All six new results are 25 directly. The unexplained
regression spans remain; comb self-consistency does not identify their physical
cause, nor prove every new top is correct.

The fade gap is real: in 48055..48195 the new rule has 35 frames with a missing
top, and seven of those change absolute placement. At frame 48063, tops (0,293)
publish (8,7), versus (1,0) at 48062, with an abstaining comb. Relative-shift
fallback survives; a still-measured field-2 top can move both fields. Thus the
rule does not implement a general fade freeze. Its decided-comb agreement in
that span does improve 6/86 -> 86/86. No additional fade/state rule was authorized
or added; this limitation is explicit in the engine documentation.

Normal, ASan/UBSan and TSan checks pass, including default-vs-explicit controls,
both pairings, and missing-top fallback assertions. Default non-audit engine
thread CPU is 0.114250 ms/unit median, 0.802917 p95 (old 0.232917/0.853225).
Detailed populations, gains/losses, raw-row numbers, instrument errors and all
outputs are in /private/tmp/top-rule-promotion.28Tfev/REPORT.md and summary.json.
No push or render. Mutual review remains required before treating this build
as accepted for publication.
