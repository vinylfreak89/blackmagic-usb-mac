# Frameserver and decision sidecar

The default frameserver and OBS registration path is the approved geometry
engine. The v9 engine and its schema-9 writer have been removed. See
[geometry_engine.md](../../docs/geometry_engine.md) for the measurement,
publication, parameter and schema-28 contract.

Decision rows are transport-unit keyed, with an independent published-frame
pair in `frame_d1/frame_d2`. Under reversed pairing, `frame_top_unit` names
the next unit supplying field 1; `applied_d1/applied_d2` describe the fields
owned by the row's own unit. Reversed pairing delays unit completion by one
unit; consumers pair fields according to the logged ownership. Measurements
and explicit unavailable values are retained separately from placement.
`log_header` in frameserver.c defines the complete, unchanged CSV column set.

## Deterministic audio evidence

The parser/delivery thread writes audio correlations and snapshots the matching
correlation when it emits a video-unit observation. That input-order boundary,
not the video worker's scheduling, is the decision log's evidence cutoff.
`audio_residual_ticks` and `audio_step_samples` use that immutable snapshot,
which travels with the unit through its existing bounded queue and reversed
pairing. No extra queue, per-unit allocation, wait or video buffering is added.

If the resync is absent at this cutoff, or has already left the 256-entry
correlation history, both cells stay empty. A later resync cannot retroactively
fill them. This is a deterministic placeholder rule for the same ordered input,
not a zero residual or evidence that audio itself is absent. Ineligible transport
and dropped-pool observations retain their existing empty-cell policy. Residual steps
still compare published units within one epoch and audio anchor generation;
missing evidence does not invent a step or a new anchor.

Live `fp_frame.audio_pts_known/audio_pts_num` are separate: they retain the
publication-time best-effort lookup, so available later evidence may timestamp
the frame even when its log cells are empty. That bounded seqlock lookup may
also abstain during concurrent writes. The OBS timestamp policy, PCM, media
publication order and registration decisions are unchanged.

`make tests/audio_lookup_probe` builds a diagnostic replay which timestamps
failed lookups and compares ingress with publication evidence.
`tests/audio_lookup_stress` additionally yields the writer inside its update;
report those scheduler-perturbed counts separately from natural replay rates.
Neither probe nor scheduler hook is enabled in production. `audio_evidence_test`
uses a condition-handshaked writer overlap and covers eviction, late/missing
audio, epochs and pending-item ownership; it is included in native and sanitizer
targets.

## Loss accounting

- A pool-full observation retains its own ordinary row, is unpublished, and says `PoolFull`.
- Ring-full observations cannot reach the worker individually. Their count is attached to the
  next retained row as `preceding_ring_drops`, locating the omitted ordinal range immediately
  before that row.
- If no later observation exists, one synthetic `RingFullTail` row is emitted. Its `ordinal` is
  the first omitted ordinal and `preceding_ring_drops` is the number of omitted observations.
  It is a range marker, not a captured video unit.
- `PublisherFull` means analysis completed but no output surface was available.
- Short, unframed and other ineligible observations keep their provenance and
  explicit drop reason; they do not receive fabricated raster measurements.

These rules preserve the conservation relation between ingress observations,
sidecar rows/ranges, and published or explicitly dropped units.

## Checks and worker budget

`make test test-geometry test-pairing` exercises transport, publication,
configuration, measurement and pairing. ASan/UBSan and TSan variants are
`test-asan test-geometry-asan` and `test-tsan test-geometry-tsan`.

`make bench CAPTURE=/path/input.tpc SIDECAR=/non-synced/new.csv
TIMINGS=/non-synced/new.timings.csv` runs the real geometry worker at 4x.
Use `BENCH_ARGS="--pair-next"` or `--pairing-schedule FILE` for the input's
field ownership. No engine environment settings are required. `bench-geometry`
is an alias. Timing begins at classifier entry and ends at item completion,
including geometry's conditional 2-D search, assembly/publication and sidecar
formatting, excluding queue waits and input I/O. The report separates units
with zero, one and two 2-D searches. Run isolated; count holes and drops and
compare every sidecar byte with the registered reference.
